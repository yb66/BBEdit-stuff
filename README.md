# BBEdit stuff #

These are some of the text filters and scripts I use with [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

Drop any of these in `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit` and then either  `Text Filters` or `Scripts` (the right one, obviously:) to use. I'm running a version of Ruby higher than the OS X system one, so try to update to something recent (2.2 or more).

Or you can clone straight into the directory via:

    git clone https://github.com/yb66/BBEdit-stuff.git "~/Library/Application/Support/BBEdit/


## Note ##

These should all work with TextWrangler too. Just replace "BBEdit" with "TextWrangler" to find the right place to install them as they share a directory layout and config file structure.


## Licence ##

This is here so there's not a licence file floating around inside the BBEdit stuff and confusing anyone (there's already 2 readmes now I've added this, no need to multiply the confusion).
